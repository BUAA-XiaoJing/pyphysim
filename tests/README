Put test scripts here.

* Organization and naming conventions

You should create one file with the tests for each package. This file
should be called PACKAGENAME_package_test.py

Note that some modules have doctests, therefore the first TestCase class in
PACKAGENAME_package_test should simple run the doctests for each module in
the PACKAGENAME package. Then you should create TestCases for each class in
each module.

* Running the tests

Each package test script should have in its __main__ the line below
: unittest.main()
so that all tests in the script can be conveniently run.

In order to easily run all the tests in all the scripts in this folder,
install the python-nose package and then run the *nosetests* program in this
folder. It will automatically run all the unittests in all the scripts
here.

If you don't want to install nose, then run the following command from this
folder
: python -m unittest discover --pattern=*.py
