Requirements:
 - python sphinx
 - sphinx aafig extension
   The aafig extension can be downloaded at
   http://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinxcontrib-aafig/
 - sphinx numpydoc extension

   The numpydoc extension is available as a python package and can be
   installed with pip. That is, if you have pip installed run the command
   bellow (as root or preceded by sudo) to install the numpydoc extension
   : pip install numpydoc
   

*Run make html to generate the documentation (_build/index.html)*


Sphinx is used to generate the documentation.  Note that we use the numpy
convention in the docstrings and therefore it is necessary to install the
"numpydoc" Sphinx extension.

In order to write the documentation you must create .rst files that sphinx
will then process.

Using some directives such as ".. automodule:: " sphinx will automatically
create documentation from the python code.
