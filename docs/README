*Run make html to generate the documentation (_build/index.html)*


Sphinx is used to generate the documentation.

In order to write the documentation you must create .rst files that sphinx
will then process.

Using some directives such as ".. automodule:: " sphinx will automatically
create documentation from the python code.
