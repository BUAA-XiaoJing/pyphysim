*Run make html to generate the documentation (_build/index.html)*


Sphinx is used to generate the documentation.  Note that we use the numpy
convention in the docstrings and therefore it is necessary to install the
"numpydoc" Sphinx extension.

In order to write the documentation you must create .rst files that sphinx
will then process.

Using some directives such as ".. automodule:: " sphinx will automatically
create documentation from the python code.


Tip: See http://stackoverflow.com/a/4690279 for tips on how write good
docstrings. Basically, The docstrings are split into several sections and
look like this:
--8<---------------cut here---------------start------------->8---
    Compute the sum of the elements of a list.

    Parameters
    ----------
    foo: sequence of ints
       The list of integers to sum up.

    Returns
    -------
    res: int
       sum of elements of foo

    See also
    --------
    cumsum:  compute cumulative sum of elemenents
--8<---------------cut here---------------end--------------->8---
