class BlockDiaginalizer(object):
    """Class to perform the block diagonalization algorithm in a joint
    transmission scenario.

    In the block diagonalization algorithm either a single base station
    with more antennas transmits for multiple users at the same time or a
    group of base stations acts as a single transmitter to send data to the
    multiple users at the same time. In both cases the block
    diagonalization algorithm assures that each receiver does not see
    interference from the other receivers.

    The waterfilling algorithm is also applied to optimally distribute the
    power. However, in the case with multiple base stations, the power
    restriction in each base station must be respected. Therefore, after
    the power is optimally allocated at each base station all powers will
    be normalized to respect the power restriction of the base transmitting
    the highest energy. This is what is done in the
    :meth:`block_diagonalize` method.

    If the power should not be optimally allocated with the waterfilling
    algorithm, use the :meth:`block_diagonalize_no_waterfilling` method
    instead. The power restriction in each base station will still be
    respected, but the base station will equally divide its power among the
    available dimensions. Note that the result will be similar to
    :meth:`block_diagonalize` in the high SNR regime.

    Examples
    --------

    Consider the case where we have 3 base station (BSs) jointly
    transmitting to 3 users, where each base station has a power of 1.5, the
    number of antennas (at each BS and at each receiver) is 2, and the
    noise variance is 1e-4. The channel can be block diagonalized for this
    scenario with

    >>> bs_power = 1.5
    >>> noise_var = 1e-4
    >>> num_users = 2
    >>> Ntx = 2  # Number of transmit antennas (per BS)
    >>> Nrx = 2  # Number of receive antennas (per user)
    >>> # Create the BlockDiaginalizer object
    >>> bd = BlockDiaginalizer(num_users, bs_power, noise_var)
    >>> channel = np.array([[-0.9834-0.0123j,  0.6503-0.3189j,  0.5484+1.7049j, -1.0891-0.1025j], [-0.5911-0.3055j, -0.6205+0.3375j, -0.7995+0.3723j,  0.7412-1.2537j], [-0.2732+0.475j , -0.4191+0.4019j,  0.1047-0.5592j,  0.7548-1.0214j], [ 0.5377-0.208j , -0.1480-1.0527j, -0.6373+0.4081j, -0.5854-0.8135j]])
    >>> (newH, Ms) = bd.block_diagonalize(channel)

    We can see that the equivalent channel (after applying the Ms
    modulation matrix) is really block diagonalized.

    >>> print newH.round(4)
    [[ 0.0916+0.0135j -1.7449-0.4328j  0.0000-0.j     -0.0000-0.j    ]
     [-0.0114-0.146j   0.0213-1.1366j  0.0000-0.j      0.0000-0.j    ]

    Notice how the power restriction of each BS is respected (although only
    one BS will transmit with its maximum power).

    >>> print (np.linalg.norm(Ms[:,0:Ntx])**2).round(4)
    1.4997
    >>> print (np.linalg.norm(Ms[:,Ntx:])**2).round(4)

    The block diagonalization algorithm is described in [1]_, where
    different power allocations are illustrated. The
    :class:`BlockDiaginalizer` class implement two power allocation
    methods, a global power allocation, and a 'per transmitter' power
    allocation.

        Notes
        -----
        The reason why the Block Diagonalization algorithm was broken down
        into the code here and the power scaling code is because the power
        scaling may changing depending on the scenario. For instance, if
        the transmitter corresponds to a single base station the the power
        may be distributed into all the dimensions of the Modulation
        matrix. On the other hand, if the transmitter corresponds to
        multiple base stations jointly transmitting to multiple users then
        the power of each base station must be distributed only into the
        dimensions corresponding to that base station.

    ----------
    mtChannel : 2D numpy array
        Global channel matrix
    num_users : int
        Number of users
    iPu : float
        Power available for each user
    noise_var : float
        Noise variance

    Returns
    -------
    (newH, Ms_good) : A tuple of numpy arrays
        newH is a 2D numpy array corresponding to the Block
        diagonalized channel, while Ms_good is a 2D numpy array
        corresponding to the precoder matrix used to block diagonalize
        the channel.

    Notes
    -----
    The block diagonalization algorithm is described in [1]_, where
    different power allocations are illustrated. The :class:`BlockDiaginalizer`
    class implement two power allocation methods, a global power
    allocation, and a 'per transmitter' power allocation.
