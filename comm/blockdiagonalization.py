class BlockDiaginalizer(object):
    """Class to perform the block diagonalization algorithm in a joint
    transmission scenario.

    In the block diagonalization algorithm either a single base station
    with more antennas transmits for multiple users at the same time or a
    group of base stations acts as a single transmitter to send data to the
    multiple users at the same time. In both cases the block
    diagonalization algorithm assures that each receiver does not see
    interference from the other receivers.

    The waterfilling algorithm is also applied to optimally distribute the
    power. However, in the case with multiple base stations, the power
    restriction in each base station must be respected. Therefore, after
    the power is optimally allocated at each base station all powers will
    be normalized to respect the power restriction of the base transmitting
    the highest energy. This is what is done in the
    :meth:`block_diagonalize` method.

    If the power should not be optimally allocated with the waterfilling
    algorithm, use the :meth:`block_diagonalize_no_waterfilling` method
    instead. The power restriction in each base station will still be
    respected, but the base station will equally divide its power among the
    available dimensions. Note that the result will be similar to
    :meth:`block_diagonalize` in the high SNR regime.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_users : int
        Number of users.
    iPu : float
        Power available for EACH user.
    noise_var : float
        Noise variance (power in linear scale).

    Examples
    --------

    Consider the case where we have 3 base station (BSs) jointly
    transmitting to 3 users, where each base station has a power of 1.5, the
    number of antennas (at each BS and at each receiver) is 2, and the
    noise variance is 1e-4. The channel can be block diagonalized for this
    scenario with

    >>> bs_power = 1.5
    >>> noise_var = 1e-4
    >>> num_users = 2
    >>> Ntx = 2  # Number of transmit antennas (per BS)
    >>> Nrx = 2  # Number of receive antennas (per user)
    >>> # Create the BlockDiaginalizer object
    >>> bd = BlockDiaginalizer(num_users, bs_power, noise_var)
    >>> channel = np.array([[-0.9834-0.0123j,  0.6503-0.3189j,  0.5484+1.7049j, -1.0891-0.1025j], [-0.5911-0.3055j, -0.6205+0.3375j, -0.7995+0.3723j,  0.7412-1.2537j], [-0.2732+0.475j , -0.4191+0.4019j,  0.1047-0.5592j,  0.7548-1.0214j], [ 0.5377-0.208j , -0.1480-1.0527j, -0.6373+0.4081j, -0.5854-0.8135j]])
    >>> (newH, Ms) = bd.block_diagonalize(channel)

    We can see that the equivalent channel (after applying the Ms
    modulation matrix) is really block diagonalized.

    >>> print (newH + 1e-10 + 1e-10j).round(4)
    [[ 0.0916+0.0135j -1.7449-0.4328j  0.0000+0.j      0.0000+0.j    ]
     [-0.0114-0.146j   0.0213-1.1366j  0.0000+0.j      0.0000+0.j    ]

    Notice how the power restriction of each BS is respected (although only
    one BS will transmit with its maximum power).

    >>> print (np.linalg.norm(Ms[:,0:Ntx])**2).round(4)
    1.4997
    >>> print (np.linalg.norm(Ms[:,Ntx:])**2).round(4)

    Notes

    The block diagonalization algorithm is described in [1]_, where
    different power allocations are illustrated. The
    :class:`BlockDiaginalizer` class implement two power allocation
    methods, a global power allocation, and a 'per transmitter' power
    allocation.

        Notes
        -----
        The reason why the Block Diagonalization algorithm was broken down
        into the code here and the power scaling code is because the power
        scaling may changing depending on the scenario. For instance, if
        the transmitter corresponds to a single base station the the power
        may be distributed into all the dimensions of the Modulation
        matrix. On the other hand, if the transmitter corresponds to
        multiple base stations jointly transmitting to multiple users then
        the power of each base station must be distributed only into the
        dimensions corresponding to that base station.

        """Set the metric used to decide how many streams to sacrifice for
        external interference handling.

        The modification to the standard Block Diagonalization algorithm
        performed in this class consists in avoid transmit data in the
        subspace strongly occupied by the external interference source.

        This sacrificing (not transmitting) of streams may or may not be
        worth it and different metrics can be used to decide this.

        The valid values for the `metric` argument are 'None' (python None
        object), "fixed", "naive", "capacity" and "effective_throughput".
        Each of these values will impact on how the number of transmit
        streams is chosen and which subspace is actually used for the
        desired signal.

        For the "fixed" and "naive" metrics, the number of transmit streams
        is determined by the value of the 'num_streams' key in the
        metric_func_extra_args_dict. The difference between them is how the
        subspace where the useful data is determined (for the given number
        of sacrificed streams).

        For the "naive" metric, the stream reduction is performed by
        multiplying the usual block diagonalizing matrix M by a subset of
        the identity matrix. For the "fixed" metric the subspace containing
        the lowest remaining external interference energy is chosen by
        multiplying the block diagonalizing matrix M by the singular vectors
        of the external interference covariance matrix corresponding to the
        lowest singular values. The same procedure is used for the other
        metrics.

        Differently from the "naive" and "fixed" metrics, the "capacity"
        and "effective_throughput" metrics try to determine this best
        number of sacrificed streams.

        - If `metric` is None, then all streams will be used. That is, no
          streams will be sacrificed and the external interference won't be
          mitigated.

        - If metric is "None" or "naive" then the specified number of
          streams will be used.

        - If `metric` is 'capacity', then the metric used to decide how
          many streams to sacrifice will be the sum capacity. The function
          :meth:`._calc_shannon_sum_capacity` will be used to calculate the
          sum capacity metric, and since it only uses the SINR values, no
          extra arguments are required in the metric_func_extra_args_dict
          dictionary.

        - If `metric` is 'effective_throughput' then the metric used to
          decide how many streams to sacrifice will be the effective
          throughput that can be obtained. The function
          :meth:`._calc_effective_throughput` will be used to calculate the
          effective throughput. Since it requires the a modulator and a
          packet length you should set the metric_func_extra_args_dict so
          that it has the keys 'modulator' and 'packet_length' with the
          correct values (a modulator object and an integer, respectively)

        Parameters
        ----------
        metric : str, {None, 'capacity', 'effective_throughput'}
            The metric name. Must be one of the available metrics.
        metric_func_extra_args_dict : dict
            A dictionary containing the extra arguments that must be passed
            to the metric function. For the "naive" and "fixed" metrics,
            this dictionary must contain the "num_streams" keyword with the
            desired number of transmit streams. For the
            "effective_throughput" metric this dictionary mst contain the
            "modulatro" and "packet_length" keywords with a modulator
            object and an integer, respectivelly. For the other metrics
