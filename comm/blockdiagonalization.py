    transmission scenario. That is, multiple base stations act as a single
    transmitter to send data to the users.

    The waterfilling algorithm is also applied to optimally distribute the
    power. However, since we have multiple base stations, each one with a
    power restriction, then after the power is optimally allocated at each
    base station all powers will be normalized to respect the power
    restriction.

    Notes
    -----
    The block diagonalization algorithm is described in [1]_, where
    different power allocations are illustrated. The :class:`BlockDiaginalizer`
    class implement two power allocation methods, a global power
    allocation, and a 'per transmitter' power allocation.

        """Calculates the modulation matrix "M" without any king of power
        scaling.

        The "modulation matrix" is a matrix that changes the channel to a
        block diagonal structure and it is the first part in the Block
        Diagonalization algorithm. The returned modulation matrix is
        equivalent to Equation (12) of [1]_ but without the power scaling
        matrix $\Lambda$. Therefore, for the compelte BD algorithm it is
        still necessary to perform this power scalling in the output of
        _calc_BD_matrix.

        The reason why the Block Diagonalization algorithm was broken down
        into the code here in the _calc_BD_matrix method and the power
        scaling code is because the power scaling may changing depending
        on the scenario. For instance, if the transmitter corresponds to a
        single base station the the power may be distributed into all the
        dimensions of the Modulation matrix. On the other hand, if the
        transmitter corresponds to multiple base stations jointly
        transmitting to multiple users then the power of each base station
        must be distributed only into the dimensions corresponding to that
        base station.
